This is followed by the name, parentheses and a colon. Then follows the body of the def, indented one level. Code in the body must be further indented as required by Python's syntax. Good practice has the body start with a triple quoted comment section explaining the def, just like Python source code files. A function may or may not take arguments. In the examples, the two defs each have a single argument. The return keyword is used to specify what is returned to the calling program. \n",

    "\n",
    "i) Placed at the top of the source code file that needs them, right after the triple quoted comment block. The def can then be used in any of the following code in the same source file. The def would not be available to code outside this source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) defs are placed in a separate source code file. They must then be read by the code that needs them using the import command, just like Pythons built-in packages. If for example the defs times10 and divby3 are put in a source file called mydefs.py, then they can be imported using the command\n",
    "\n",
    "import mydefs\n",
    "\n",
    "and used like \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Typically related defs are bundled in the same source file. \n",
    "defs organized in this way are also called modules or packages. This is how one re-uses and shares Python code. 'Global variables' can also usefully be placed in a module file - Above any defs that need them, of course. These global variables will then be defined for any Python program that imports that module. Global variables, following the convention of the C language, are usually capitalized:\n",
